# CertifiedGPT: Adversarial Robustness Evaluation of Vision And Language Models Against Targeted Black Box Attacks

This repository contains the code for CertifiedGPT, a pipeline to certify the adversarial robustness of multimodal vision and language model against
visual perturbations in input images. 

This work is inspired by, and builds upon, concepts from the paper [*Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02918) by [*Jeremy Cohen*](https://jmcohen.github.io/), Elan Rosenfeld, and [*Zico Kolter*](https://zicokolter.com/).

CertifiedGPT was Developed by Leonardo Souza under the supervision of [*Pedro Nuno de Souza Moura*](https://ppgi.uniriotec.br/professores-do-ppgi/pedro-moura/) and [*Maíra Athanázio de Cerqueira Gatti*](https://ppgi.uniriotec.br/professores-do-ppgi/mgdebayser/) from the [*The Graduate Program in Computer Science (PPGI)*](https://ppgi.uniriotec.br/) at [*UNIRIO*](https://www.unirio.br/).

## How does it work?
This research is associated with a master's dissertation defended at UNIRIO in 2025. The official version of the dissertation will be made available on the UNIRIO institutional digital library and the Sucupira Platform once the publication process is complete. The corresponding research article has been submitted for peer review but is not yet published.

# CertifiedGPT: Adversarial Robustness Evaluation of Vision And Language Models Against Targeted Black Box Attacks

This repository contains the code for CertifiedGPT, a pipeline that can be used to certify the adversarial robustness of a multimodal model (Vision and Language) against
visual perturbations in the input images. 

This work is inspired by and builds upon concepts from the paper [*Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02918) by [*Jeremy Cohen*](https://jmcohen.github.io/), Elan Rosenfeld, and [*Zico Kolter*](https://zicokolter.com/).

Pipeline Developed by Leonardo Souza under the supervision of **Pedro Nuno de Souza Moura** and **Maíra Gatti de Bayser** from the **Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO)**.

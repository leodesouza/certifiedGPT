# CertifiedGPT: Adversarial Robustness of Vision And Language Models Against Targeted Black Box Attacks

This repository contains the code of CertifiedGPT, a strategy to improve the **Adversarial Robustness of Vision and Language Models Against Targeted Black Box Attacks**, developed by Leonardo Souza under the supervision of **Pedro Nuno de Souza Moura** and **Ma√≠ra Gatti de Bayser** from the **Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO)**.

The work is inspired by and builds upon concepts from the paper [*Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02918) by Jeremy Cohen, Elan Rosenfeld, and Zico Kolter.
